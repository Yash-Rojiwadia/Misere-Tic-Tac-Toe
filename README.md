# Mis√®re-Tic-Tac-Toe
How to Play:
- The game is similar to ordinary tic tac toe in terms of mechanism, Mouse Clicks are used to register moves in the form of X (Player 1) and 0 (Player 2).
It differentiates itself with its rubric of who wins, instead of striving to gain three figures in a row, the user must do the exact opposite. A user must corner their opponent into having three in a row.
- Thus, if done successfully, a user can win by the opponent having three figures in a row.
