# Misère-Tic-Tac-Toe
## How to Play
Misère-Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game. Instead of aiming to get three figures in a row, the objective is to force your opponent into getting three in a row.

To play the game, simply click on the desired cell to place your symbol. Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O". The game ends when one player gets three figures in a row or when all cells are filled without either player winning.

## Rules
1. The game is played on a 3x3 board.
2. The first player to make a move is chosen randomly.
3. The players take turns placing their symbols on an empty cell.
4. The game ends when one player has three figures in a row or all cells are filled without a winner.
5. The winner is the player who forces their opponent to get three figures in a row.
